The EtherWallet smart contract code allows you to receive Ether from any Ethereum address.
The minimum amount someone can send to the smart contract (to you) is 0.2ETH and above.
The smart contract code automatically keeps record of addresses that have sent Ether to you.
You can also withdraw the Ether sent to the smart contract to your Ether wallet.
